\begin{abstract}
Presto is a SQL query engine developed specially for interactive analytics. It
focuses on large commercial data warehouses with capacity of gigabytes to
petabytes. It is open source and used for distributed systems. It is compatible
with relational as well as NoSQL data sources such as Cassandra and 
Hive~\cite{hid-sp18-502-Presto}.

It is being used by big organizations like Facebook to run interactive queries
against their large data warehouses. The main advantage of using Presto is that
it allows to perform analytics on data from different data sources using single
query. This allows data to be combined across organizations without extra
overhead of separate queries for each data source~\cite{hid-sp18-502-Presto}.
